通常发生在代词中he，him，his，her，在句中经常被省略h的发音

而在开头或者意群开头时，不会省略

let her go

kiss her

catch her

talk with her

help his classmate

meet his friend

was he angry

would he

did he

除了h，ing的g/ŋ/有时会被发成/n/

going on  有点像none



#### 失爆

爆破音： p b t d k g

- 当爆破音后面跟其他辅音，不释放气流
- 依然做出口型和舌位

- 两个词之间有停顿

每个爆破音发完整会非常吃力，所以要失去爆破

that man

big car

ask them

next day

web chat

im just looking

she‘s at home

what dish do you like

what color do you want

break down

help me

stop talking 

the dog barks

#### 缩写

wanna = want to

gonna = going to

gotta = have to
